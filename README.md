# Emotion_Detector
This program will detect basic emotions (sad, ok, happy) of a given sentence. 
Emotions will be outputed as 1, 2, or 3. 
The numbers correspond to emotions (sad = 1, ok = 2, happy = 3)
For this program to work a couple of things are required. 

Must provide a TSV file with 2 columns 

The first row of the first column should be called Review and the first row of the second column should have a name (anything you want).

The first column should be filled with sentences 

The second column should be filled with what emotion (1, 2, or 3) the sentence is in its respective row 

It is important that you provide sufficient amount of data for this program
to work. At least 10 sentences varying in emotion (1-3) should be provided. If you provide sentences other than 1000, change the for loop range from 1000 to 
however many sentences you provided. The more sentences provided and the more varied it is, the more
accurate the program will predict a given sentence. 

Lastly, provide a sentence that you want to predict the emotion of at the end of the first column and leave the emotion corresponding to it empty as it will be predicted 
by the program. 

Run program and look at what number is printed out at the very end and see what emotion it corresponds to.
